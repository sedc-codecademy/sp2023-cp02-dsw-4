## 🚀 Welcome to Click & Ship! 🚀

Drop-shipping store where elegance meets convenience, offering a minimalist
design that ensures seamless navigation. Enchanting shopping experience that
prioritizes style, functionality, and customer satisfaction!

## 🎯 Project Overview 🎯

Hello there, brave explorer! You've just landed on the README page of our exciting Dropshipping Project. Buckle up and get ready for a thrilling journey!

**Click & Ship** is a dynamic and robust platform built with a variety of modern technologies. The frontend of the application was constructed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. To manage the application state, we utilized Redux Toolkit, a powerful toolset for efficient Redux development. For data fetching, caching, and state updates, we incorporated React Query into our tech stack. To style our components and layout, we used SCSS, a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted into CSS.

On the backend, we used C#.NET, a multi-paradigm programming language for building robust and scalable web applications. For our database, we chose MySQL, a reliable and efficient open-source relational database management system.

This diverse tech stack allowed us to create a highly interactive and user-friendly dropshipping platform.
